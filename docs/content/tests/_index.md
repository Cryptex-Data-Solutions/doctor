Testing `doctor` is essential. That is why every six hours, `doctor` gets tested on GitHub Actions. This way, we can make sure that the tool keeps responding to the expected behavior.

If you are interested in the test results, you can check each of the latest test results for all platforms:

- [Linux](./linux/)
- [macOS](./macos/)
- [Windows cmd](./windows/)
- [Windows PowerShell](./windows_powershell/)
